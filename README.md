# ResearchOps AI

## Autonomous Research Intelligence Operating System

ResearchOps AI is an AI-powered research intelligence platform designed to move beyond traditional PDF chatbots and static literature review tools.

Instead of simply summarizing papers, ResearchOps AI builds a persistent, evolving layer of structured research intelligence across documents, workflows, and projects.

The system combines:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Autonomous workflow orchestration
- Persistent contextual memory
- Research synthesis
- Insight generation
- Citation grounding
- Knowledge extraction
- Research roadmap generation

into a unified research operations platform.

# Vision

Most AI research tools today are:
- PDF chatbots
- generic summarizers
- stateless assistants

ResearchOps AI is designed as:

> A persistent research cognition system that continuously reads, organizes, connects, critiques, and evolves scientific knowledge.

The long-term goal is to build:
- contextual research memory
- contradiction detection
- claim consensus systems
- research gap discovery
- evolving knowledge graphs
- autonomous literature intelligence

# Core Features

## Autonomous Research Workflow Engine

ResearchOps AI executes multi-stage autonomous research workflows:

## Persistent Research Memory

The system maintains contextual memory across workflows and projects.

Unlike stateless AI systems, ResearchOps AI stores:
- research insights
- synthesis outputs
- workflow conclusions
- citations
- domain intelligence
- prior context

This enables future workflows to retrieve only relevant historical knowledge.

---

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The platform uses semantic retrieval over uploaded research corpora.

Capabilities include:
- PDF ingestion
- chunking
- embedding generation
- FAISS vector indexing
- semantic retrieval
- grounded response generation

---

## Research Intelligence Generation

The platform automatically generates:
- executive summaries
- literature reviews
- research insights
- future research roadmaps
- emerging trend analysis
- research gaps
- citation-grounded outputs

---

## Workflow Orchestration

Research workflows are orchestrated using LangGraph.

Each workflow node operates independently:
- retrieval agent
- synthesis agent
- insight agent
- literature review agent
- planning agent
- citation agent
- memory agent

This modular architecture enables scalable autonomous research operations.
